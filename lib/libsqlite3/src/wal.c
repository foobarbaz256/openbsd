** This file contains the implementation of a write-ahead log (WAL) used in 
** "journal_mode=WAL" mode.
**
** WRITE-AHEAD LOG (WAL) FILE FORMAT
**
** A WAL file consists of a header followed by zero or more "frames".
** Each frame records the revised content of a single page from the
** database file.  All changes to the database are recorded by writing
** frames into the WAL.  Transactions commit when a frame is written that
** contains a commit marker.  A single WAL can and usually does record 
** multiple transactions.  Periodically, the content of the WAL is
** transferred back into the database file in an operation called a
** "checkpoint".
**
** A single WAL file can be used multiple times.  In other words, the
** WAL can fill up with frames and then be checkpointed and then new
** frames can overwrite the old ones.  A WAL always grows from beginning
** toward the end.  Checksums and counters attached to each frame are
** used to determine which frames within the WAL are valid and which
** are leftovers from prior checkpoints.
**
** The WAL header is 32 bytes in size and consists of the following eight
** big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer values:
**
**     0: Magic number.  0x377f0682 or 0x377f0683
**     4: File format version.  Currently 3007000
**     8: Database page size.  Example: 1024
**    12: Checkpoint sequence number
**    16: Salt-1, random integer incremented with each checkpoint
**    20: Salt-2, a different random integer changing with each ckpt
**    24: Checksum-1 (first part of checksum for first 24 bytes of header).
**    28: Checksum-2 (second part of checksum for first 24 bytes of header).
**
** Immediately following the wal-header are zero or more frames. Each
** frame consists of a 24-byte frame-header followed by a <page-size> bytes
** of page data. The frame-header is six big-endian 32-bit unsigned 
** integer values, as follows:
**
**     0: Page number.
**     4: For commit records, the size of the database image in pages 
**        after the commit. For all other records, zero.
**     8: Salt-1 (copied from the header)
**    12: Salt-2 (copied from the header)
**    16: Checksum-1.
**    20: Checksum-2.
**
** A frame is considered valid if and only if the following conditions are
** true:
**
**    (1) The salt-1 and salt-2 values in the frame-header match
**        salt values in the wal-header
**
**    (2) The checksum values in the final 8 bytes of the frame-header
**        exactly match the checksum computed consecutively on the
**        WAL header and the first 8 bytes and the content of all frames
**        up to and including the current frame.
**
** The checksum is computed using 32-bit big-endian integers if the
** magic number in the first 4 bytes of the WAL is 0x377f0683 and it
** is computed using little-endian if the magic number is 0x377f0682.
** The checksum values are always stored in the frame header in a
** big-endian format regardless of which byte order is used to compute
** the checksum.  The checksum is computed by interpreting the input as
** an even number of unsigned 32-bit integers: x[0] through x[N].  The
** algorithm used for the checksum is as follows:
** 
**   for i from 0 to n-1 step 2:
**     s0 += x[i] + s1;
**     s1 += x[i+1] + s0;
**   endfor
**
** Note that s0 and s1 are both weighted checksums using fibonacci weights
** in reverse order (the largest fibonacci weight occurs on the first element
** of the sequence being summed.)  The s1 value spans all 32-bit 
** terms of the sequence whereas s0 omits the final term.
**
** On a checkpoint, the WAL is first VFS.xSync-ed, then valid content of the
** WAL is transferred into the database, then the database is VFS.xSync-ed.
** The VFS.xSync operations serve as write barriers - all writes launched
** before the xSync must complete before any write that launches after the
** xSync begins.
**
** After each checkpoint, the salt-1 value is incremented and the salt-2
** value is randomized.  This prevents old and new frames in the WAL from
** being considered valid at the same time and being checkpointing together
** following a crash.
**
** READER ALGORITHM
**
** To read a page from the database (call it page number P), a reader
** first checks the WAL to see if it contains page P.  If so, then the
** last valid instance of page P that is a followed by a commit frame
** or is a commit frame itself becomes the value read.  If the WAL
** contains no copies of page P that are valid and which are a commit
** frame or are followed by a commit frame, then page P is read from
** the database file.
**
** To start a read transaction, the reader records the index of the last
** valid frame in the WAL.  The reader uses this recorded "mxFrame" value
** for all subsequent read operations.  New transactions can be appended
** to the WAL, but as long as the reader uses its original mxFrame value
** and ignores the newly appended content, it will see a consistent snapshot
** of the database from a single point in time.  This technique allows
** multiple concurrent readers to view different versions of the database
** content simultaneously.
**
** The reader algorithm in the previous paragraphs works correctly, but 
** because frames for page P can appear anywhere within the WAL, the
** reader has to scan the entire WAL looking for page P frames.  If the
** WAL is large (multiple megabytes is typical) that scan can be slow,
** and read performance suffers.  To overcome this problem, a separate
** data structure called the wal-index is maintained to expedite the
** search for frames of a particular page.
** 
** WAL-INDEX FORMAT
**
** Conceptually, the wal-index is shared memory, though VFS implementations
** might choose to implement the wal-index using a mmapped file.  Because
** the wal-index is shared memory, SQLite does not support journal_mode=WAL 
** on a network filesystem.  All users of the database must be able to
** share memory.
**
** The wal-index is transient.  After a crash, the wal-index can (and should
** be) reconstructed from the original WAL file.  In fact, the VFS is required
** to either truncate or zero the header of the wal-index when the last
** connection to it closes.  Because the wal-index is transient, it can
** use an architecture-specific format; it does not have to be cross-platform.
** Hence, unlike the database and WAL file formats which store all values
** as big endian, the wal-index can store multi-byte values in the native
** byte order of the host computer.
**
** The purpose of the wal-index is to answer this question quickly:  Given
** a page number P and a maximum frame index M, return the index of the 
** last frame in the wal before frame M for page P in the WAL, or return
** NULL if there are no frames for page P in the WAL prior to M.
**
** The wal-index consists of a header region, followed by an one or
** more index blocks.  
**
** The wal-index header contains the total number of frames within the WAL
** in the mxFrame field.
**
** Each index block except for the first contains information on 
** HASHTABLE_NPAGE frames. The first index block contains information on
** HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE frames. The values of HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE and 
** HASHTABLE_NPAGE are selected so that together the wal-index header and
** first index block are the same size as all other index blocks in the
** wal-index.
**
** Each index block contains two sections, a page-mapping that contains the
** database page number associated with each wal frame, and a hash-table 
** that allows readers to query an index block for a specific page number.
** The page-mapping is an array of HASHTABLE_NPAGE (or HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE
** for the first index block) 32-bit page numbers. The first entry in the 
** first index-block contains the database page number corresponding to the
** first frame in the WAL file. The first entry in the second index block
** in the WAL file corresponds to the (HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE+1)th frame in
** the log, and so on.
**
** The last index block in a wal-index usually contains less than the full
** complement of HASHTABLE_NPAGE (or HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE) page-numbers,
** depending on the contents of the WAL file. This does not change the
** allocated size of the page-mapping array - the page-mapping array merely
** contains unused entries.
**
** Even without using the hash table, the last frame for page P
** can be found by scanning the page-mapping sections of each index block
** starting with the last index block and moving toward the first, and
** within each index block, starting at the end and moving toward the
** beginning.  The first entry that equals P corresponds to the frame
** holding the content for that page.
**
** The hash table consists of HASHTABLE_NSLOT 16-bit unsigned integers.
** HASHTABLE_NSLOT = 2*HASHTABLE_NPAGE, and there is one entry in the
** hash table for each page number in the mapping section, so the hash 
** table is never more than half full.  The expected number of collisions 
** prior to finding a match is 1.  Each entry of the hash table is an
** 1-based index of an entry in the mapping section of the same
** index block.   Let K be the 1-based index of the largest entry in
** the mapping section.  (For index blocks other than the last, K will
** always be exactly HASHTABLE_NPAGE (4096) and for the last index block
** K will be (mxFrame%HASHTABLE_NPAGE).)  Unused slots of the hash table
** contain a value of 0.
**
** To look for page P in the hash table, first compute a hash iKey on
** P as follows:
**
**      iKey = (P * 383) % HASHTABLE_NSLOT
**
** Then start scanning entries of the hash table, starting with iKey
** (wrapping around to the beginning when the end of the hash table is
** reached) until an unused hash slot is found. Let the first unused slot
** be at index iUnused.  (iUnused might be less than iKey if there was
** wrap-around.) Because the hash table is never more than half full,
** the search is guaranteed to eventually hit an unused entry.  Let 
** iMax be the value between iKey and iUnused, closest to iUnused,
** where aHash[iMax]==P.  If there is no iMax entry (if there exists
** no hash slot such that aHash[i]==p) then page P is not in the
** current index block.  Otherwise the iMax-th mapping entry of the
** current index block corresponds to the last entry that references 
** page P.
**
** A hash search begins with the last index block and moves toward the
** first index block, looking for entries corresponding to page P.  On
** average, only two or three slots in each index block need to be
** examined in order to either find the last entry for page P, or to
** establish that no such entry exists in the block.  Each index block
** holds over 4000 entries.  So two or three index blocks are sufficient
** to cover a typical 10 megabyte WAL file, assuming 1K pages.  8 or 10
** comparisons (on average) suffice to either locate a frame in the
** WAL or to establish that the frame does not exist in the WAL.  This
** is much faster than scanning the entire 10MB WAL.
**
** Note that entries are added in order of increasing K.  Hence, one
** reader might be using some value K0 and a second reader that started
** at a later time (after additional transactions were added to the WAL
** and to the wal-index) might be using a different value K1, where K1>K0.
** Both readers can use the same hash table and mapping section to get
** the correct result.  There may be entries in the hash table with
** K>K0 but to the first reader, those entries will appear to be unused
** slots in the hash table and so the first reader will get an answer as
** if no values greater than K0 had ever been inserted into the hash table
** in the first place - which is what reader one wants.  Meanwhile, the
** second reader using K1 will see additional values that were inserted
** later, which is exactly what reader two wants.  
**
** When a rollback occurs, the value of K is decreased. Hash table entries
** that correspond to frames greater than the new K value are removed
** from the hash table at this point.

** A copy of the following object occurs in the wal-index immediately

** information used by checkpoint.
**
** nBackfill is the number of frames in the WAL that have been written
** back into the database. (We call the act of moving content from WAL to
** database "backfilling".)  The nBackfill number is never greater than
** WalIndexHdr.mxFrame.  nBackfill can only be increased by threads
** holding the WAL_CKPT_LOCK lock (which includes a recovery thread).
** However, a WAL_WRITE_LOCK thread can move the value of nBackfill from
** mxFrame back to zero when the WAL is reset.
**
** There is one entry in aReadMark[] for each reader lock.  If a reader
** holds read-lock K, then the value in aReadMark[K] is no greater than
** the mxFrame for that reader.  The value READMARK_NOT_USED (0xffffffff)
** for any aReadMark[] means that entry is unused.  aReadMark[0] is 
** a special case; its value is never used and it exists as a place-holder
** to avoid having to offset aReadMark[] indexs by one.  Readers holding
** WAL_READ_LOCK(0) always ignore the entire WAL and read all content
** directly from the database.
**
** The value of aReadMark[K] may only be changed by a thread that
** is holding an exclusive lock on WAL_READ_LOCK(K).  Thus, the value of
** aReadMark[K] cannot changed while there is a reader is using that mark
** since the reader will be holding a shared lock on WAL_READ_LOCK(K).
**
** The checkpointer may only transfer frames from WAL to database where
** the frame numbers are less than or equal to every aReadMark[] that is
** in use (that is, every aReadMark[j] for which there is a corresponding
** WAL_READ_LOCK(j)).  New readers (usually) pick the aReadMark[] with the
** largest value and will increase an unused aReadMark[] to mxFrame if there
** is not already an aReadMark[] equal to mxFrame.  The exception to the
** previous sentence is when nBackfill equals mxFrame (meaning that everything
** in the WAL has been backfilled into the database) then new readers
** will choose aReadMark[0] which has value 0 and hence such reader will
** get all their all content directly from the database file and ignore 
** the WAL.
**
** Writers normally append new frames to the end of the WAL.  However,
** if nBackfill equals mxFrame (meaning that all WAL content has been
** written back into the database) and if no readers are using the WAL
** (in other words, if there are no WAL_READ_LOCK(i) where i>0) then
** the writer will first "reset" the WAL back to the beginning and start
** writing new content beginning at frame 1.

** this routine during the current read attempt that returned WAL_RETRY.
** This routine will start taking more aggressive measures to clear the

** number of errors will ultimately return SQLITE_PROTOCOL.  The
** SQLITE_PROTOCOL return indicates that some other process has gone rogue
** and is not honoring the locking protocol.  There is a vanishingly small

** bad luck when there is lots of contention for the wal-index, but that
** possibility is so small that it can be safely neglected, we believe.
**

** WAL_READ_LOCK(pWal->readLock).  The pWal->readLock integer is
** in the range 0 <= pWal->readLock < WAL_NREADER.  If pWal->readLock==(-1)
** that means the Wal does not hold any read lock.  The reader must not
** access any database page that is modified by a WAL frame up to and
** including frame number aReadMark[pWal->readLock].  The reader will
** use WAL frames up to and including pWal->hdr.mxFrame if pWal->readLock>0
** Or if pWal->readLock==0, then the reader will ignore the WAL
** completely and get all content directly from the database file.
** If the useWal parameter is 1 then the WAL will never be ignored and
** this routine will always set pWal->readLock>0 on success.
** When the read transaction is completed, the caller must release the
** lock on WAL_READ_LOCK(pWal->readLock) and set pWal->readLock to -1.
**
** This routine uses the nBackfill and aReadMark[] fields of the header
** to select a particular WAL_READ_LOCK() that strives to let the
** checkpoint process do as much work as possible.  This routine might
** update values of the aReadMark[] array in the header, but if it does
